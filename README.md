## üè† Introduction

Welcome to the "RentWise" a US Rental price prediction project, where we delve into the intricate world of rental property pricing in the United States. In this data-driven endeavor, we harness the power of data science techniques, including Linear Regression and Decision Trees, to shed light on the dynamics of rental housing prices. Our ultimate objective is to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately estimate these prices, offering invaluable insights for renters, landlords, and the ever-evolving real estate industry.


## üéØ Project Overview

The project's primary focus is to leverage machine learning to tackle the complex challenges associated with rental housing pricing. We aim to answer pressing questions, such as:

1. What factors influence rental property prices in different regions of the United States?
2. Can we build a model that accurately predicts rental prices?
3. How do amenities, location, and property types affect the cost of rent?
4. What insights can we extract from the data to inform both renters and landlords?


## üìä Dataset

The dataset comes from **Kaggle**, a famous site with thousands of amazing datasets to work it. Each row represents a unique Rental property in different states of US, and each column a different attribute. Some of the key features in my dataset are:

## üöÄ Roadmap

  - ### üßπ [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/kartik-kakar/RentWise-Predicting-Rental-Property-Prices-In-US/blob/37ec38d5514f697f7f2a22d29b820da12f05bae9/1.%20Data_Cleaning.ipynb)
       It involved cleaning the raw dataset ensuring that the data is ready for analysis. We dropped the unecessary columns and dealt with missing 'NaN' values. Then we saved the cleaned dataset file to use for 
       further EDA.

  - ### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/kartik-kakar/RentWise-Predicting-Rental-Property-Prices-In-US/blob/9558fd78019ddd15a0bda9d723c69bdd4251874b/2.%20EDA.ipynb)
       We investigated the dataset's characteristics, relationships, and patterns using visualizations and statistical techniques, providing insights for model selection and feature engineering. We removed the 
       outliers from our dataset to get more realilstic findings and saved up our modified file for future use. 

  - ### üß† Feature Engineering and üìä Modelling
       Next, we focused on data transformation, converted all the categorical columns to numerical ones ensuring that features are meaningful and suitable for machine learning. Then, we split our data into test and train set, prepared for model training and tried out the following models on the entire dataset:
    -  Linear Regression
    -  Ridge Regression
    -  Lasso Regression
    -  Decision Tree
    -  Random Forest
    -  Neural Network Regressor

      We then scaled our dataset, ran the models again and compared them using the R2 and MSE metric.

## üìù Learnings

Till now, we have cleaned our dataset and decided our Target variable, i.e, 'price' and have made a lot of visualization revealing the relationships between different variables. We have also done the feature engineering and made and compared few baseline models for our project. After comparison, we learned that the Random Forest Regressor model consistently demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and generalization having the highest R2 Score of more than 84.00% both before and after scaling.
